# FRender - ?
FRender is Modern JavaScript UI Liblary.
The name stands for FastRender.
It works on almost every browser.
It's Super Fast, and it's only 4KB of JavaScript.
It's super easy to learn & master because of it's simplicity.

# Where are components?
I'll do components ASAP.

# A Liblary of Framework
Kinda stupid question, yeah.
So basiclly, Liblary is a thing which is used by developer's code. And framework runs developer's code.
FRender runs your Code written in HTML/JavaScript ({{ * }} syntax).
So you can call it framework. But for me it's a little too small yet to call it framework.
Maybe if it'll grow up a little then It will be officially a Framework.
